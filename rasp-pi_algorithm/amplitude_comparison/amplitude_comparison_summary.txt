Experiment detail:
Put speaker at the relatively same location to different microphpone, to see whether all microphone have the same gain.
By processing data directly from input, rather than after power estimation.
Channel input bias can be checked at the same time.

Experiment setup:
source: smarphone --bluetooth--> speaker
volumn: max * 0.25
signal_type: sine
frequency_hz: 500
distance_cm: 20
Run: 1000
File: bias_observation.py

Experiment result:
Get the scaling ratio based on amplitude.
But the data from channel 5 and 6 is weird, which lacks 25%, 50% data, indicating the values are really low.
Futher experiment is to use these scaling ratio (amplitude) to compare power estimation result.
