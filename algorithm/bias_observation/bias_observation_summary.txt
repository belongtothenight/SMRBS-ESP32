Experiment detail:
Put speaker at the relatively same location to different microphpone, to see whether all microphone have the same gain.
By processing data directly from input, rather than after power estimation.
Channel input bias can be checked at the same time.

Experiment setup:
source: smarphone --bluetooth--> speaker
volumn: max * 0.25
signal_type: sine
frequency_hz: 500
distance_cm: 20
Run: 50
File: bias_observation.py

Experiment result:
Everytime the stream is started, it takes few runs/seconds to stable.
It is recommended to keep the stream alive to keep channel without bias.
